# 🧬 Genomic AI System

The **Genomic AI System** is an advanced AI-powered platform for analyzing genomic data to support **precision medicine**, **public health surveillance**, and **biotech research**. It focuses on diseases such as **Hepatitis B & C**, **HIV**, and **Malaria**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🧠 Transformer-based models for genomic sequence classification
- 📊 Predicts mutation risk, drug resistance, and phenotype associations
- 🧼 Automated genomic data preprocessing and QC
- 🛡️ Secure file handling with SHA256 hashing and AES-256 encryption
- 🔌 REST API support (via FastAPI) for real-time model access
- ☁️ Dockerized for easy deployment on cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP)

## 🔍 Modules
- `preprocess/`: Quality control and normalization pipelines
- `model/`: Training, evaluation, and prediction scripts
- `api/`: FastAPI server for accessing models externally
- `config/`: YAML-based config files for reproducibility

## 🐳 Deployment
```bash
docker-compose up --build
